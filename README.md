# RNDraw

- A simple example of Drawing App built on React Native (v0.47.0) + Redux + [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg)
- Code is based on [react-native-paint](https://github.com/maticaputti/react-native-paint)
- Added redo feature and doesn't rely on Expo
- Tested only on iOS, seems like react-native-svg having issue with android
